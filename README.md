# MAN-QSM(ICME2023)
A masked attention network with query sparsity measurment for time series anomaly detection
We propose a masked attention network with Query Sparsity Measurement (MAN-QSM) for time series anomaly detection. We optimize the anomaly criterion by introducing prior knowledge of the difference between normal-abnormal self-attention score distribution and uniform distribution; on the other hand, we design the mask mechanism to amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability under the synergy of the training strategy.

* Introduce the Query Sparsity Measurement (QSM) based on sequence dynamic information that can be generalized to various anomalies.
* Use the mask mechanism that effectively amplifies normal-abnormal distinguishability.
